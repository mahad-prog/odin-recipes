    <h2>Some feedback</h2>
    <p><i>This is an amazing recipe. I never thought to put these two ingredients together. Very original!!! It was a bit complex to follow. It is rather difficult to measure peanut butter in a table spoon without getting it all over your fingers. However, once you get the hang of it, it is amazing. I would have preferred to use a knife, but it did not say to do this, so I used my hand. My hand is very sticky now, but this creation is worth it.</i></p>
    <p><i>I've made this recipe many many times and it always turns out perfectly. This is the perfect recipe to give to your grown children when they leave the nest. Thanks for sharing, lol</i></p>
