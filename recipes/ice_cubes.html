    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Take the trays over to the sink and fill them with cold water. (Hot water will freeze faster and more clear).</li>
        <li>Place the water filled ice trays back in the freezer</li>
        <li>Replace the ice bin if you had to remove it</li>
        <li>Shut the door to the freezer</li>
        <li>Be sure to leave for around 4-6 hours at least to make sure it is frozen</li>
        <li>If you want to experiment, you can freeze things like fruit infused waters or juices</li>
    </ol>
